# <div style="text-align: center;">ForestBerryNet: A Dual-Backbone Architecture with Hierarchical Attention Fusion for Efficient Forest Berry Detection</div>


## Introduction 
ForestBerryNet is a lightweight dual-backbone architecture designed for efficient forest berry detection, tailored for deployment on resource-constrained platforms such as drones and edge devices.

This repository hosts the source code, pre-trained models, and configuration files for the ForestBerryNet model, which integrates CSPDarknet and HGNetV2 backbones with a Hierarchical Attention Fusion (HiAFusion) module to enhance multi-scale feature representation. The model also incorporates a Lightweight Hybrid Encoder (with Efficient Up-convolution Block and Heterogeneous Convolutional Branch Refinement) and a Lightweight Decoder optimized via grouped convolutions, ensuring a balance between detection accuracy and computational efficiency.
